# FinanceLab — Financial Intelligence Service

I built FinanceLab as a financial intelligence system designed to automate financial statement analysis, evaluate business health, and translate raw financial data into decision-ready insights.

It combines structured financial modeling with large language models to deliver data-grounded financial analysis through natural-language interaction.

FinanceLab functions as a financial analysis engine that consistently reads financial statements, computes key metrics, flags risks, and explains what the numbers mean.

What FinanceLab Is

I built FinanceLab as a Node.js-based financial analysis service that connects structured financial data (CSV files) with an AI reasoning engine (Groq API powered by the Llama 3.3-70B model).

It ingests real financial statements, computes core financial metrics, evaluates business health, and enables users to ask natural-language questions about performance, risk, and financial position.

All insights are grounded directly in the uploaded financial data.

The Problem It Solves

Financial data is often fragmented across spreadsheets, slow to analyze manually, inconsistently interpreted, and difficult to translate into business meaning.

I built FinanceLab to standardize and automate this process by:
- Structuring financial statements
- Computing key performance and risk metrics
- Evaluating financial health
- Simulating financial scenarios
- Generating executive-style financial summaries

The goal is to reduce manual analysis friction and make financial intelligence consistent, scalable, and decision-focused.

What FinanceLab Does

Financial Statement Analysis

My system loads and structures income statements, cash flow statements, and balance sheets.

It extracts and computes over 17 core financial metrics, including:
- Revenue growth
- Gross, operating, and net margins
- Return on equity
- Return on assets
- Liquidity ratios
- Leverage and solvency ratios
- Cash generation indicators

Business Health Assessment

FinanceLab evaluates financial condition across five core dimensions:
- Profitability
- Liquidity
- Leverage
- Returns
- Cash flow health

It identifies strengths, weaknesses, and emerging risk conditions based on structured financial logic.

Scenario Simulation

FinanceLab supports scenario-based financial reasoning, such as:
- Revenue growth or decline
- Margin shifts
- Debt increases
- Cost structure changes

The system estimates how these changes impact financial ratios, business health, and risk exposure, supporting forward-looking analysis.

Executive Financial Summaries

My system automatically generates:
- Business performance overviews
- Financial strengths and weaknesses
- Risk indicators
- Opportunity signals
- Strategic observations

Outputs are structured for clarity and rendered using formatted markdown for readability and reporting.

Example Questions FinanceLab Can Answer

• What is driving the change in profitability?
• Is the company becoming financially riskier?
• Why is cash flow diverging from net income?
• What happens if revenue grows by 20%?
• How sensitive is the business to increased debt?

Each response is grounded in actual financial figures and calculated metrics.

How FinanceLab Works

1. Financial data is loaded from CSV statements
2. Core financial metrics and ratios are calculated
3. Business health logic evaluates performance and risk
4. Structured financial context is generated
5. User questions are combined with financial context
6. The AI model produces data-backed analysis
7. Results are rendered as structured financial insights
8. Reports can be exported for documentation and review

This flow formalizes how financial analysis is performed and translates it into a repeatable analytical system.

Key Features

• Data-grounded financial reasoning
• Automated metric and ratio computation
• Business health and risk assessment
• Scenario modeling
• Executive-style financial summaries
• Multi-question conversational analysis

What This Project Demonstrates

FinanceLab reflects my applied capability in:
- Financial statement analysis
- Financial modeling logic
- Performance and risk assessment
- Scenario analysis
- Analytical system design
- Data pipeline construction
- Automation of financial workflows
- Translation of financial data into business meaning

This project was built to explore how financial reasoning can be formalized, automated, and scaled.

Why FinanceLab Was Built

I developed FinanceLab to encode how a financial analyst thinks into a working system — one that consistently evaluates financial health, detects risk, and explains business performance using structured financial logic.

This project focuses on the intersection of finance, systems engineering, and decision intelligence.

How to Use FinanceLab

1. Open the live application
2. Load or select a financial dataset
3. Ask financial questions in natural language
4. Review metrics, insights, and health assessments
5. Explore scenario simulations and summaries
6. Export analysis for documentation or reporting
